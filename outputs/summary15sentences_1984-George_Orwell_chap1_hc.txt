His hair was fair and the skin on his face, which used to be pink, was red and rough from cheap soap, old razor blades and the cold of the winter that had just ended. He moved to the window. The telescreen had a microphone, so the Thought Police could listen to Winston at any time of the day or night. And he could see the Ministry of Love - Miniluv - which was responsible for law and order. Earlier that morning, a terrible noise from the big telescreen at the Ministry of Truth had called all the workers to the centre of the hall for the Two Minutes Hate. Goldstein began to speak in his sheep-like voice: criticising the Party, making nasty attacks on Big Brother, demanding peace with Eurasia. Goldstein had also written a book, a terrible book, a book against the Party. As Goldstein's face filled the telescreen and Eurasian soldiers marched behind him, the Hate grew. Winston was shouting too; it was impossible not to. A girl behind him, with thick, dark hair was screaming 'Pig! Pig!' at Goldstein, and suddenly she picked up a heavy Newspeak dictionary and threw it at the telescreen. He disliked nearly all women, especially young and pretty ones. As the screaming at Goldstein increased, Winston's dislike of the girl turned to hate. There was sometimes an intelligence in his face that suggested - perhaps - that he might question the official Party beliefs. Winston wrote the date in his diary: April 4th 1984. You were, in Newspeak, vaporized.
